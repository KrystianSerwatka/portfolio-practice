# Portfolio - test

Yes it is a test portfolio :)

----

## Why I created a test portfolio?

It may seem to some people that it makes no sense to create a portfolio that I won't really use, but this is about the techniques on the site that I was interested in.

I decided to create a test portfolio almost 2 years ago, inspired by this movie -> [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFVhAfRHjTo&ab_channel=Codegrid)

Then I was at the very beginning of the front-end and I was very interested in the animation of the elements appearing after a certain time. Anyway I liked the style of the site very much :) Recently I've been browsing through my old projects from the computer and found out that I'll improve it and make it under the current projects that I've made and that I want to make.

## What have I learned in this project?

I learned in this project:
- How to create multiple bookmarks on one page, then combine them into one project(currently I would do it in a different way because the one that is currently not practical for me)
- How can you aesthetically create code in HTML and CSS + comments (of course now I would do it differently, more aesthetically)
- How can I implement the appropriate JS library for my project and how to use it. In this case it was - wow.js

## What made me most of the problems?

From what I remember, I had no problems with this project. Maybe light with the responsiveness of the site 2 years ago.

## What did I change in this project?

First of all, while doing this project, I was doing everything for myself - information about me, projects, etc. I also added the possibility to send an email. I did it using PHP. I simply changed contact.html to contact.php, I also added code in submitForm.php, which is responsible for sending an email. I also added a thank-you.html file, which is a thank you file for sending an email. I added there an information that this email will not reach me because I don't have a hosting option to set up an email under my name, I'm currently using gmail, and from what I've read, sending emails using the form + PHP only works on hosting emails.

## What would I change if I created such a project for today?

In a word - everything. But why?

Therefore, because I am richer with these 2 years of experience. First of all I would make the code more readable in HTML and I would optimize the CSS code more (currently I think there is a lot of optimization possible), I would minimize @mediaqueries to a minimum without interfering with many elements, but I would do everything using bootstrap. Of course if it would be a website to publish (and I guess so) then I would also do everything that goes into SEO standards for better position in Google searches.

## A few words from me

This is not a top-flight project, but 2 years ago it enriched me with many additional experiences.
